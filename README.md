1) I would say 2 because it's important to check code before push. We need to do quality control before commit, especially when the recipe project is a little bit complex project that involves multiple js files. This would also help avoid situation that we find error in code later and do multiple resubmission to fix it, which provide spaces for github conflicts. 

2) No.

3) No. This feature involves multiple interaction (write & send & response) and it's too complex for a unit testing. 
   
4) Yes. This feature is a simple and in small scale that can be tested using simple if statements. Also, it does not affect other app features like write & send.
